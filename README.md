## Installation

This code was developed with Python 3.5 on Ubuntu 16.04. Python libraries required: numpy, scipy optimize, matplotlib, sklearn and skopt.

V-REP: Version 3.5.0*

PyBullet: Version 2.1.1

*Please add vrep.py, vrepConst.py and remoteApi.so files relevant for your distribution of V-Rep to the Software directory.

## Running

To execute run main.py

There are three arguments.

1. Physics Engine: A string. The choice is between 'PyBullet', 'Bullet278', 'Bullet283', 'ODE' and 'Newton'.
2. Experiment number: This is an intiger between 1-6. Where 1 = 1&2, 2 = 3&4, ..., 6 = 11
3. Individual/Shared Params: 0=Shared and 1=Individual

## Results and Metrics

The results from execution main.py will be saved in the Results directory. The results are in the form of .csv files. To understand further read the code in logger.py.
